## What to Validate

When changing loaders or merge logic, please confirm:

- [ ] **Priority merging** still works as intended (e.g., `.env` > `yaml` > `json`).
- [ ] **Deep merging** works correctly (nested objects merge without overwriting sibling keys).
- [ ] **Missing files** are handled gracefully (warnings, no crash).

---

## Code Style

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation (not tabs).
- Add **comments** for complex code.
- Write **meaningful commit messages**.
